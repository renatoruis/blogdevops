            <description>Introduction Don&amp;rsquo;t Repeat Yourself DRY is a good design goal and Hugo does a great job supporting it. Part of the art of a good template is knowing when to add a new template and when to update an existing one. While you&amp;rsquo;re figuring that out, accept that you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing some refactoring. Hugo makes that easy and fast, so it&amp;rsquo;s okay to delay splitting up a template.</description>
